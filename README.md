## How it functions
 This application uses MySQL, Inquirer, and Node.js. You may wish to jump start managing your employees by creating
 a database in MySQL and seed your database with a seed.sql file. You will have to navigate to the folder you saved the application and run npm install. Once the package is installed you can run node server.js and this command will start the application.
